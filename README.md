# DeepTraffic
This repository is for the deep traffic competition held by MIT open course: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars, taught by Lex Fridman.
The link to the course materials is: https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/, where all the course videos and slides, as well as the competition can be found.

The course includes four competitions, amoung which there are two competitions released to the public. DeepTraffic is one of them that the aim is to control a car driving as fast as possible in the traffic flow.

By setting different parameters and training the model iteratively, the car knows how to alleviate other cars (which are randomly controlled in the traffic) and when to accelerate/decelerate.

The bottom line to pass the competetion is to reach the average speed higher than 65 mph. Luckily, I achieved around 72 mph. The highest score I got is 72.56 mph. It is able to pass the competition, but still far away from those genius on the leaderboard.

The content below is my methods and intuitions to acheve 72.56 mph.
